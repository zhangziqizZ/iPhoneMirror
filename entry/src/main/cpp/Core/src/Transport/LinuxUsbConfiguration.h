// LIBUSB_ERROR_BUSY because usbmuxd had selected its own configuration in
// between ("Connected to v2.0 device 1" at 14:51:18.406). Those 14 ms were spent

// configuration, with nothing in between.
//
// Windows needs none of this: AppleUsbFilter leaves the selected configuration
// alone and there is no second daemon competing for it.
