// Linux environment readiness probe. The Windows environment report answers
// "is Apple Mobile Device Support installed and running, and can a USB backend
// see the phone". The Linux answers come from different places, and two of them
// have no Windows counterpart at all:
//
//  - usbmuxd is a system service reachable over a unix-domain socket rather
//    than loopback TCP, and it may be socket-activated, so a missing socket and
//    a stopped service are different findings.
//  - Access to /dev/bus/usb is governed by udev. usbmuxd's own rule sets
//    OWNER="usbmux" on Apple devices, so an ordinary desktop user cannot open
//    the device node until this project's rule grants the group. That is the
//    single most common reason wired capture cannot start on Linux, so the
//    probe reports it explicitly instead of surfacing a generic open failure.
