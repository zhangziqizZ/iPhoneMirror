# Third-party notices

This file describes third-party material intentionally included in the source
tree or release package. Each component remains under its upstream license.
The root GNU General Public License v3.0 only applies to original iPhoneMirror
material and does not replace, narrow or relicense any component listed below.

## quicktime_video_hack protocol fixtures

The binary fixtures in `src/Core/tests/fixtures/quicktime_video_hack/` are
unmodified protocol captures from Daniel Paulus' `quicktime_video_hack`
project. They are used only as interoperability test vectors; no upstream
implementation source is copied into iPhoneMirror.

- License: MIT
- Included license: `src/Core/tests/fixtures/quicktime_video_hack/LICENSE`

## libusb 1.0.29

`third_party/libusb/` contains the public headers, x64 runtime DLL and import
library used by the optional libusb-1.0 transport. iPhoneMirror dynamically
links to the library.

- Project: https://github.com/libusb/libusb
- License: GNU Lesser General Public License 2.1 or later
- Included license: `third_party/libusb/COPYING`

## libusb-win32 1.2.6.0

`third_party/libusb-win32/` contains the public compatibility header and the
x64 dynamic import library used by the native core. The main application ships
the signed upstream x64 `libusb0.dll` user-mode runtime so it can start before
the capture filter is installed. The standalone driver manager carries the
remaining signed runtime and kernel-driver payload under
`src/DriverInstaller/Assets/libusb-win32-1.2.6.0/`.

- Project: https://github.com/mcuee/libusb-win32
- Release archive: https://sourceforge.net/projects/libusb-win32/files/libusb-win32-releases/1.2.6.0/
- Dynamic import library: GNU Lesser General Public License version 3
- Driver payload licenses: `src/DriverInstaller/Assets/libusb-win32-1.2.6.0/COPYING_GPL.txt`,
  `COPYING_LGPL.txt`, `README.txt` and `AUTHORS.txt`
- Driver payload hashes and signature validation are enforced by
  `src/DriverInstaller/Services/DriverConstants.cs` and `DriverPayload.cs`.

The driver manager does not copy proprietary Aisi binaries. Apple USB support
is installed from a signed offline AppleMobileDeviceSupport MSI when available,
from the Apple Devices Microsoft Store product through Windows Package Manager,
or from Apple's official HTTPS iTunes installer as a compatibility fallback.
Apple software is not redistributed in this repository or its release assets.

## Microsoft Visual C++ runtime

The Windows release includes app-local x64 copies of `msvcp140.dll`,
`vcruntime140.dll` and `vcruntime140_1.dll`. They satisfy the runtime imports of
the bundled libusb and AirPlayServer binaries on clean Windows installations.
The build copies these files only from an installed Visual Studio Redistributable
directory after validating their Microsoft Authenticode signatures.

## AirPlayServer 1.1.2 wireless receiver

`third_party/airplay-server/` contains a pinned runtime subset of the
AirPlayServer x64 release with local compatibility patches. The GPL-licensed
`iPhoneMirror.WirelessHost.exe` process loads its protocol/decoder DLL and sends
decoded I420 video and PCM audio to the GPL-3.0-only application over a named
pipe. The application and native capture core do not link to the receiver DLL.

- Project: https://github.com/xenos1337/AirPlayServer
- Version/commit: v1.1.2 / `34ba6cfd49b2432cf30e89913d66decb775763e4`
- AirPlayServer wrapper: MIT
- PlayFair implementation and receiver runtime: GPL version 3
- FFmpeg 4.4.2 runtime: LGPL version 2.1 or later
- Fraunhofer FDK AAC: Fraunhofer FDK AAC license
- Exact hashes, source links and license files:
  `third_party/airplay-server/SOURCE.md`

## FFmpeg 8.1.2 media-output runtime

The default release uses an FFmpeg essentials build staged at `tools/ffmpeg/`.
An explicitly requested compact edition may omit this runtime and use a
user-installed FFmpeg from `PATH`. The bundled runtime is prepared by
`scripts/prepare_ffmpeg.ps1`, which verifies the published archive SHA-256
before copying `ffmpeg.exe`, the license, build README and source record into
the application output. This runtime is independent of the older FFmpeg DLLs
distributed with AirPlayServer.

- Binary package: https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/packages/ffmpeg-8.1.2-essentials_build.zip
- Upstream FFmpeg source: https://ffmpeg.org/releases/ffmpeg-8.1.2.tar.xz
- License for the distributed essentials build: GNU General Public License v3
- Included license and build/source metadata: `tools/ffmpeg/LICENSE.txt`,
  `tools/ffmpeg/README.txt` and `tools/ffmpeg/SOURCE.txt`
- Pinned archive and extracted-file hashes:
  `scripts/ffmpeg-runtime-manifest.psd1`
- The build enables GPL components such as libx264 and is therefore distributed
  under GPLv3 terms. It encodes projection video and, when available, muxes the
  captured iPhone PCM audio into recordings and live-streaming output.

## Markdig Markdown processor

The in-app update window uses Markdig 1.3.2 to parse GitHub Release notes into
safe WPF document elements. Markdig is distributed under the BSD 2-Clause
License. Source and license: https://github.com/xoofx/markdig

## WPF-UI 4.3.0 and Microsoft Fluent System Icons

The main application and standalone driver manager use WPF-UI 4.3.0. Its
`SymbolIcon` control embeds the Microsoft Fluent System Icons font in the
WPF-UI assembly, so application icons do not depend on fonts installed in
Windows.

## Inno Setup installer engine

The Windows Setup executable is built with Inno Setup 6.7.3. The compiler is
downloaded from the official JRSoftware GitHub release and verified against the
SHA-256 recorded in `scripts/inno-runtime-manifest.psd1`. The generated Setup
engine is redistributed under the Inno Setup License:

# Linux port components

The components in this section are used only by the Linux build of this fork.
The Linux build vendors no prebuilt binaries: every component below is either a
system library resolved at build time or built from upstream source. See
`docs/LINUX_PORT.md` for the fork's modification notice.

## UxPlay

The Linux wireless receiver replaces the Windows-only vendored
`airplay2dll.dll` with UxPlay's AirPlay receiver library, built from upstream
source. UxPlay is GPL-3.0, which is compatible with this project's
GPL-3.0-only license. UxPlay itself incorporates PlayFair (GPL-3.0) and
llhttp (MIT); those notices travel with the UxPlay source tree.

## libplacebo

Used by the Linux preview renderer for NV12/P010 handling, colour management,
PQ/HLG tone mapping and dmabuf import. Dynamically linked.

- Project: https://code.videolan.org/videolan/libplacebo
- License: GNU Lesser General Public License 2.1 or later

## FFmpeg

The Linux build decodes H.264/HEVC and AAC/ALAC through the distribution's
FFmpeg libraries (`libavcodec`, `libavutil`, `libswresample`, `libswscale`)
instead of the vendored Windows FFmpeg runtime. Dynamically linked.

- Project: https://ffmpeg.org/
- License: GNU Lesser General Public License 2.1 or later, depending on the
  distribution's build configuration

## libusb

The Linux USB transport links against the distribution's libusb-1.0 rather
than the vendored Windows headers, import library and DLL under
`third_party/libusb/`. Dynamically linked.

- Project: https://github.com/libusb/libusb
- License: GNU Lesser General Public License 2.1 or later

## Avahi

DNS-SD service registration and browsing use Avahi's `libdns_sd` compatibility
layer, which replaces this project's Windows-only `DnsSdShim`. Dynamically
linked.

- Project: https://github.com/avahi/avahi
- License: GNU Lesser General Public License 2.1 or later

## PipeWire

Audio playback on Linux uses PipeWire's client library in place of WASAPI.
Dynamically linked.

- Project: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pipewire/pipewire
- License: MIT

## systemd libudev

Linux USB device discovery uses libudev in place of SetupAPI and cfgmgr32.
Dynamically linked.

- Project: https://github.com/systemd/systemd
- License: GNU Lesser General Public License 2.1 or later

## Avalonia

The Linux graphical shell replaces the Windows-only WPF and WPF-UI user
interface with Avalonia, resolved as a NuGet dependency.

- Project: https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia
- License: MIT

## Fluent System Icons

The OpenHarmony shell replaces the WPF-UI `SymbolIcon` glyphs (which render the
Fluent System Icons font) with the icons' own vector paths, drawn by ArkUI's
`Shape` + `Path`. The unmodified SVG sources are vendored under
`tools/fluent-icons/`, and `tools/gen_fluent_icons.py` turns them into
`entry/src/main/ets/common/FluentIcon.ets`. No coordinate is altered.

- Project: https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui-system-icons
- Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation
- License: MIT
- Upstream license: https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui-system-icons/blob/main/LICENSE

## OpenHarmony system libraries (no third-party binary bundled)

The OpenHarmony media, audio, USB and graphics backends in
`entry/src/main/cpp/ohos/` link only against system NDK libraries that ship with
the OS and are resolved at load time — `libusb_ndk.z.so` (USB DDK),
`libnative_media_vdec.so` / `libnative_media_codecbase.so` /
`libnative_media_core.so` (AVCodec), `libohaudio.so` (OHAudio),
`libnative_window.so` and `libEGL.so` / `libGLESv3.so`
(NativeWindow / GLES). No third-party binary is redistributed with this port.

All third-party components are provided without warranty.
